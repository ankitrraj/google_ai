## Approach Summary
This submission represents a realistic baseline using pattern-matching approaches:
- Basic transformations (rotations, flips, scaling)
- Color replacements and mappings
- Spatial operations (borders, cropping, tiling)
- Symmetry and shift operations

## Limitations Discovered
- Pattern matching insufficient for complex logical reasoning
- Most ARC tasks require dynamic, input-dependent transformations
- Competitive solutions use LLM-based evolutionary algorithms
- Current approach achieves ~4% success rate vs 50%+ for winners

## Recommendation
For championship-level performance, implement LLM-based evolutionary solver:
1. Use GPT-4/Claude to generate Python functions dynamically
2. Evolutionary algorithm with fitness evaluation
3. Test-time compute with multiple generation iterations
4. Expected improvement: 25-50% success rate (vs current 4%)

## Files Included
- 400 solver files (task001.py - task400.py)
- {len(working_solvers)} actual working solvers
- {400 - len(working_solvers)} identity function fallbacks
