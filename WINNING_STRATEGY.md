- **Scoring**: `max(1, 2500 - file_size_bytes)` if correct, `0.001` if wrong
- **Current leader**: ~958,000 points (avg ~2395 points per task)
- **Target**: Beat current leader with >960,000 points
- **Prize Pool**: $100,000 (1st place: $30,000)

## 🎯 Phase-by-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis & Foundation (Days 1-3)
✅ **COMPLETED**: Core infrastructure built
- Pattern analyzer to categorize all 400 tasks
- Baseline solver framework for common patterns  
- Automated testing pipeline
- Code golf optimizer

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (Days 4-7)
**NEXT STEPS**:
1. Run pattern analysis on all 400 tasks
2. Identify the top 10 most common transformation patterns
3. Prioritize tasks by pattern frequency and complexity

### Phase 3: Baseline Implementation (Days 8-14)
**Strategy**: Correctness first, optimization later
1. Create working solutions for top patterns:
   - 3x3 tiling (input → 3x3 grid of inputs)
   - Rotation/flipping transformations
   - Color mapping and replacement
   - Scaling (2x, 3x expansion)
   - Shape detection and manipulation
2. Target: 300+ correct solutions (even if not optimized)

### Phase 4: Code Golf Optimization (Days 15-21)
**Strategy**: Minimize bytes while maintaining correctness
1. Apply automated code golf rules
2. Manual optimization for high-value tasks
3. Target: Average <100 bytes per solution
4. Expected score improvement: 200+ points per task

### Phase 5: Advanced Patterns (Days 22-28)
**Strategy**: Tackle complex/unique patterns
1. Manual analysis of remaining tasks
2. Custom solvers for edge cases
3. ML/heuristic approaches for unsolved tasks

### Phase 6: Final Optimization (Days 29-30)
**Strategy**: Last-minute improvements
1. Final code golf pass
2. Submission validation
3. Leaderboard monitoring

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Tools Built:
1. **Pattern Analyzer** (`tools/pattern_analyzer.py`)
   - Categorizes tasks by transformation type
   - Identifies common patterns across dataset

2. **Baseline Solver** (`tools/baseline_solver.py`)
   - Template solutions for common patterns
   - Generates initial working code

3. **Test Runner** (`tools/test_runner.py`)
   - Validates solutions against all examples
   - Calculates competition scores

4. **Code Golfer** (`tools/code_golfer.py`)
   - Minimizes code size automatically
   - Applies golf optimization rules

### Expected Pattern Distribution:
Based on ARC-AGI analysis, expect:
- **3x3 Tiling**: ~50-80 tasks (high value, easy to golf)
- **Rotation/Flip**: ~40-60 tasks (very short solutions)
- **Color Mapping**: ~30-50 tasks (medium complexity)
- **Scaling**: ~20-40 tasks (moderate golfing potential)
- **Complex Logic**: ~100-150 tasks (manual analysis needed)

## 📈 Scoring Strategy

### Target Scores by Pattern:
- **Simple patterns** (rotation, flip): 2450+ points (50 bytes)
- **Medium patterns** (3x3 tile, scaling): 2350+ points (150 bytes)  
- **Complex patterns**: 2000+ points (500 bytes)
- **Edge cases**: 1000+ points (just get them working)

### Competitive Advantage:
1. **Automated pipeline** - faster iteration than manual coding
2. **Pattern-based approach** - systematic coverage of all tasks
3. **Code golf optimization** - maximize points per task
4. **Comprehensive testing** - ensure no failed submissions
